It allows developers to create dynamic and interactive web applications. In this tutorial, we will explore the fundamentals of JavaScript, including its syntax, data types, functions, and more.

## What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for client-side scripting in web browsers. It was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich and has since evolved into a powerful language that can also be used on the server-side with environments like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Why Learn JavaScript?

1. **Versatility**: JavaScript can be used for both front-end and back-end development.
2. **Community Support**: There is a vast community of developers and a wealth of resources available for learning.
3. **Job Opportunities**: Proficiency in JavaScript opens up numerous job opportunities in web development.
